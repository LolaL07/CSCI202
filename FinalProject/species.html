        <p>Although this is a guide for intertidal species found in Washington state, the majority of these can be found along the entire west coast of North America from California to Alaska. Also, this should be used as a starting point rather than an all encompassing guide. You will certainly find a species not listed here, at some point, and I would encourage the use of further outside research to help aid your quest. <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/">iNaturalist</a> is very helpful for identifying and recording observations.</p>
