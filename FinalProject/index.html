        <h2>A Guide to tidepooling</h2>
        <p>This guide is for anyone new to tidepooling, looking for some more information, or maybe wanting to bring other on a small adventure, and more. Below you will find some general guidelines for the safety and protection of both you and and the wildlife creatures, as well as some possibly helpful tips to make your exploring and finding a little easier.</p>

        <dl>
            <dt>Go at the lowest tide</dt>
            <dd>The majority of the creatures will be underwater if the tide isn't at it's lowest. The best heights are at about 2ft and below, with below 0ft being the most preferred. Some species will be found above this, but not as many and not as much. You should check and plan ahead for the next low tide and it's height. You can find tide predictions online at <a href="https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/tide_predictions.html?gid=1415">NOAA tide predictions</a> or other trusted sites.</dd>
            <dt>Do not disturb the wildlife</dt>
            <dd>This can mean many things but the main point is to not permanently disrupt the habit of the animals. Touch gently or not at all. Replace and re-flip any logs or rocks. Take nothing but trash. Leave nothing at all. Watch where you walk, being careful not to step on, squish, or crush anything living beneath your feet.</dd>
            <dt>Look carefully</dt>
            <dd>There are many cool creatures to see and a lot of them are quite good at hiding or blending in. You might notice so much more if you pause to observe. Looking carefully at an individual might also help you to better identify what it might be.</dd>
            <dt>Learn before you go</dt>
            <dd>Learn more about where your favorite species likes to live. Learn about the species and habitats of next place you want to go. Figure out how to differentiate two similar species of crabs or anemones. The list can go on but you should learn what interests you and</dd>

        <h2>Map</h2>
        <p>There are so many places all over Washington that anyone can go tidepooling at. Below is a map of over 20 beaches and parks where you're sure to find dozens of creatures during low tide. The types of habitats at the locations vary. Some of the beaches have deep sand and mud flats, while others might have large boulder or smaller rock pools. </p>
