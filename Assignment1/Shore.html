<!-- Moon Jellyfish - The Shore

The water cooler under the shade of the long wooden dock. Sea stars and anemones stick to the wooden pilings that sink into the waters floor. The moon jelly has found its way to the edge of the dock, but so have many others. The bloom of many moon jellyfish is not as large as others have been before but group makes polka dots in gently rolling waves.

Above the surface, a round shadow moves. Two objects thrust into the sea, and suddenly, the jellyfish is not in the waters, but ABOVE them. -->
