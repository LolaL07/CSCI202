<!-- Jellyfish of The Sea

The blue sea is wide and vast. The SURFACE is glittering with the light of the sun that illuminates the drifting plankton and sparkling scales of a school of small fish. This light filters down through the depths, almost reaching a DEEP SEA VENT that teems with strange life. The warm waters pour from a crack in the crust of the floor, flowing up and out into the waters around. -->
