    <h1>Giant Phantom Jellyfish - The Deep</h1>
    <p>Down in the darkness of the bottom of the sea, below the light waters that the sun light illuminates, lies the giant phantom jellyfish. The large ghastly thing has found its way to a underwater vent. It teems with small plankton and fish to stun drag away into its long haunting arms and depths of its interior. Perhaps a giant squid has found its next prey. Or maybe, perhaps, the large jellyfish has already escaped. </p>
