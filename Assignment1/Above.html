<!-- Moon Jellyfish - Above the Sea 

The world is all light. The sky world remains above, but the jellyfishes surroundings have been replaced. Drops of water splash against the walls of the clear container as it is carried further and further away from its home. The swaying subsides and the container comes to a rest. Whatever has stolen the small creature away pokes softly at the smooth top of the jellyfish, away from the tentacles whose sting will not cause any pain, even if was able to try.

More rapid movement occurs in the world of the sky. Long thin shadows overlap and the larger points in the direction of the sea.

A jerk upwards. The container's water again sloshes and splashes out. Scampering back towards the solid blue. It is lowered down and plops back into the silent blue world of currents and continued life. -->
