        <dt>Lightfast</dt>
            <dd>If a pigment is lightfast, it does not drastically fade in prolonged sun exposure.</dd> <br>
        <dt>Fugitive</dt>
            <dd>Fugitive pigments are ones that have poor lightfastness, they fade quickly and dramatically with light exposure. Many natural pigments are fugitive</dd> <br>
        <dt>Color Code</dt>
            <dd>This is a system that assigns a code made of letter and number identfiers to each pigment. The P and N at the beginning stand for Pigment and Natural Pigment respectivly. Then, the one or two following letters represent the color hue of the pigment, R for red, B for blue, Bk for black and so on. Each pigment in each color group is then given a number.</dd>
        <dt>Paint Mixes</dt>
            <dd>Most art supply companies will make their own colors by combining other pigments. This happens especially when the color being replicated are rare or expensive. Also, because ingredients and ratios vary, so will the color of paints. Paints with a single pigment are the most pure and mix better with other paints.</dd>
